APFS UCD PARSER
===============

This is a simple script to parse the NFD and case folding data provided by
Unicode 9.0.0 [1] into tries represented as C arrays. It also runs the
normalization tests at [1] and prints the results to build/test.out. The
unicode 9.0 data is inside the ucd directory; it can be simply replaced by
another version if such a thing is needed.

The code produced by running make will become the unicode.c and unicode.h
files of the linux-apfs module [2]. All future changes to the unicode
implementation should go through this tree before being applied to linux-apfs,
so that tests can be run.

A small part of the code was taken from a version of the mkutf8data script
by Olaf Weber [3].
